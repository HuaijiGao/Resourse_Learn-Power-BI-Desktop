Power BI Service has access to a limited number of types of data connections. But Power BI Desktop is toally different. We have six primary data sources. You can always search a particular type of data you want to retrieve in the seraching box.

Power BI is part of the Microsoft's Power Platform, such as Power BI datasets, Power BI dataflows. 

Dataverse: the updated version of the Common Data Service (Legacy). It is used by all the tools in the Power Platform and other applications like Microsoft Teams.

Microsoft SharePoint Online, Microsoft Exchange Online, Dynamics. Also including other SaaS connections, such as LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Marketo, Smartsheet, Intune Data Warehouse, Webtrends Analytics...

### :sparkles: Other
If the data source you are looking for is not in the list, choose Other. We have Web, SharePoint list, Microsoft Exchange. But, we also have the ability to retrieve data using OData feed, ODBC or OLE DB, which means we can connect to almost any data source even if there isn't a pre-built connection for it.

*Whenever we choose a data source and click connect, whatever happens next is based on the data source type we chose to connect to.*
