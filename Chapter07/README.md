# SHARE YOUR WORK

## Sharing: The basics

### Sharing
- Share a report in Microsoft Teams
  - best option if your organization uses Microsoft Teams.
- Distribute a PBIX file
  - share reports and the datasets underneath them.
  - if local data sources are included, the receiver need to change the data source location or the PBIX file will generate an error.
  - if the data sources are from non-local location, such as in a SharePoint library or OneDrive, there will be no issue.
- Upload PBIX file from the Power BI service
  - your report and your data set will be added to the Power BI service
  - another option is to publish your report to send ti to a Power BI service directly from Power BI Desktop.
  - these two options both upload the PBIX to Microsoft's PBI storage in the cloud.
